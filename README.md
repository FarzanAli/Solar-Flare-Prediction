# Solar-Flare-Prediction

From the selection of feature sets, the combination of the feature sets FS-I, FS-II, FS-IV resulted in the best True Skill Score. Descriptions for each feature set are provided:

**Current state (FS-I)**: Baseline magnetic properties of the active solar regions.<br/>
**Temporal evolution (FS-II)**: Changes in these properties over time, allowing for pattern recognition in the lead-up to a solar flare.<br/>
**Max-Min variability (FS-IV)**: The magnitude of fluctuations, which could indicate magnetic instability in the region.<br/>
